This project is a Sign Language to Text Converter designed to bridge the communication gap between individuals who use sign language and those who may not understand it. The system uses flex sensors attached to the fingers and an accelerometer to capture hand gestures. Each unique combination of finger bends and hand movements is mapped to a corresponding word or phrase.

When a gesture is recognized, the system converts it into text and sends the output wirelessly via Bluetooth to a paired device such as a smartphone or computer. At the same time, the recognized gesture is displayed on the Serial Monitor for real-time debugging and verification.

The device also supports a gesture-based screen clearing feature, allowing users to reset the communication interface using specific hand movements.

With its real-time processing, wireless communication, and customizable gesture library, this project demonstrates a wearable assistive technology that can help the hearing- and speech-impaired community communicate more easily with others.
